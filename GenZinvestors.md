### Recruiting participants for dissertation research on college students' financial goals
I'm interviewing juniors/seniors and recent grads about their financial goals and current personal finance. Interviews last around one hour and focus on your experiences with college and work, what your goals are in terms of your finances, your career, your family life, and more. I'll also ask about things like financial investment and saving, but you do not have to be investing or saving at the moment in order to participate. All participants receive a $30 Amazon gift card as a thank you!

If you're interested in participating, please sign up for a time slot below using your college email address. And thank you!
