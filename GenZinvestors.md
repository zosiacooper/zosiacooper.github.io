Iâ€™m interviewing college juniors/seniors and recent grads about their financial goals and current personal finance. The focus of my research is on financial investment, but you do not have to be an investor in order to participate. Interviews last around one hour and focus on your experiences with college and work, and what your goals are in terms of your career, your family life, and more. 

All participants receive a $30 Amazon gift card as a thank you!
