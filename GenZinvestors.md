Iâ€™m interviewing recent college graduates (within one or two years of graduation) about their financial wellbeing. Interviews last around one hour and focus on your ideas and experiences with money, experiences with college and work, and what your goals are in terms of your career, your family life, and more. The focus of my research is on financial investment as part of a range of things people do to ensure their financial wellbeing, but you do not have to be an investor in order to participate. 

All participants receive a $20 Amazon gift card as a thank you!

If you're interested in participating, please fill out the form below to let me know. And thank you!
