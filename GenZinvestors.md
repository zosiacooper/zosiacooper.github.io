### Recruiting participants for dissertation research on Gen Z investors
I'm interviewing Gen Zs who invest in financial markets. This could mean owning stocks, retirement accounts, or crypto/NFTs. Or, it could mean trading options. Interviews last around one hour and focus on how you got started with investment and what your goals are in terms of your finances, your career, your family life, and more. How is investment helping you to reach those goals? Are you sacrificing anything now in order to save for the future?
