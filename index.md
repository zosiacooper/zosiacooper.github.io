I am a doctoral student in Sociology at UC San Diego. You can access my CV here. 

I research how economic ideas are rendered as culture: orienting frameworks for our life and work. Although I pursue this interest using theoretical tools from the study of organizations and work, I largely consider myself an economic and cultural sociologist.

My dissertation focuses on college students who invest in financial markets. Collegians today face a highly uncertain future, but rather than invest in ways that mitigate this uncertainty, they are more likely than investors from other age cohorts to make risky choices. My preliminary findings that many college student investors have high financial literacy makes this pattern even more puzzling. How do cultural factors that young investors encounter on and off campus explain this contradiction?

I'm also working with [Dr. Amy Binder](https://snfagora.jhu.edu/person/amy-binder/) and [Dr. Jeffrey Kidder](https://www.niu.edu/jkidder) to understand how and why right-of-center political actors build institutions in academia. Drawing on organizational theory and the sociology of work, we explain that oppositional groups build organizations that offer them maximum autonomy over professional identity and meaning-making.
