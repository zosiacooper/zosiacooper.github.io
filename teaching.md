As an instructor of record and teaching assistant at UC San Diego, I've developed a teaching style that prioritizes equity, student feedback, and active learning. I believe transparency about how class activities are linked to learning objectives, and about the hidden curriculum that can improve student outcomes, is essential to equity-minded teaching. My syllabi always include multiple checkpoints for student feedback and classroom activities that improve learning.

At the undergraduate level, I teach a class on qualitative interviewing in which small groups collaborate on an interview project that builds on existing research on careers and work. Syllabus available [here](LINK_TO_SYLLABUS).

At the graduate level, I develop and teach workshops about academic writing and do one-on-one mentoring with students on their writing projects. More information is available at the [UCSD Writing Hub](https://writinghub.ucsd.edu/for-grad-students/index.html).
